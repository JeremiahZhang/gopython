# Using multiple CSS classes

一个 html tag 中的 class 可以使用多个.如下面的代码所示:

```
<p class="fact warning">
    Warning: Eating too many donuts can be bad for your health. Just ask Winston.
</p>
```

这样在定义 css style 时, 可以有多种选择的机会.

Seletors are semantically very similar to each other then use Grouping CSS selectors. 而不是因为我想要时这些 tag 内容一致. 因此不要滥用.
