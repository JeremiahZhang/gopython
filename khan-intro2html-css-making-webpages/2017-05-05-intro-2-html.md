![where should your tags go?](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/a88dceb91dbddc6f1c031bf92bedb90afca3ff05.png)

> The <h1> and <p> tags are the contents of the <body> tag, so we say they're "inside" the <body> tag. In fact, those tags must go inside the <body> tag, so remember that when you're writing your HTML in your first challenge. Try it out now!

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>

<html>

    <head>

        <title>"Challenge: Write a Poem"</title>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Choice</h1>
        
        <p> To be or not to be<br>
            It's a question.<br>
            What's your choice?<br>
        </p>
        
        
    </body>

</html>
```

## Text emphasis tag <em> <strong>

        <title>Challenge: You can learn text tags</title>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
    </head>
    <body>
        <p>
        <strong>Nobody’s born smart</strong>. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <em>Nobody’s good at anything at first</em>.<br>
        There was a time when Einstein couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        <strong>Thankfully, we are born to learn.</strong><br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        <em>One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.</em><br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        This. is. learning.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.
        </strong></p>
    </body>
</html>
```

## List

```
<ol> // ordered list
    <li>list item (li)<li>
</ol>

<ul> // unordered list
    <li>list item (li) here</li>
</ul>
```

```
<!DOCTYPE HTML>

<html>

    <head>

        <title>Challenge: Your learning list</title>

        <meta charset="utf-8">

    </head>

    <body>
        <ul>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>C++</li>
        </ul>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Matlab</li>
        </ol>
        
        
    </body>

</html>
```

## image tag <img>

```
<img src="SouRCe" alt="alternate text" width="100" height="100">
```

- `src`: source 图片源
- `alt`: 图片text说明
- `width`: 只一个就可以自动适应尺寸, 两个就会出现压缩不均现象
