- [python manage.py migrate --fake <app-name> zero](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23755523/how-to-reset-migrations-in-django-1-7?noredirect=1&lq=1#comment63428154_27008518)
- 可以多个压缩大小 [squashing-migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/topics/migrations/#squashing-migrations)

I did like this：

- delete `db.sqlite3`
- delete `rango/migrations directory`
- `$ python manage.py makemigrations rango`
- `$ python manage.py migrate`
- `$ python populate_rango.py`

> Customise the admin interface. Change it in such a way so that when you view the
Page model, the table displays the category, the name of the page and the url - just
like in the screenshot shown below. You will need to complete the previous exercises
or at least go through the official Django Tutorial to complete this exercise.

To do this, use the [list_display](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/contrib/admin/#django.contrib.admin.ModelAdmin.list_display) admin option, which is a tuple of field names to display, as columns, on the change list page for the object:

`rango/admin.py`

```
from django.contrib import admin

# Register your models here.

from rango.models import Category, Page

class PageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    list_display = ('title', 'category', 'url')


admin.site.register(Category)
admin.site.register(Page, PageAdmin)
```

Output:
