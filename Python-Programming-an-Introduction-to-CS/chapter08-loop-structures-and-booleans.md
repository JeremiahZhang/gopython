# 第8章 loop 结构和布尔 booleans

- 目标:
    - Definite and indefinite loops
        - `for` - definite
        - `while` - indefinite
    - 5+ Programming patterns interactive loop and sentinel loop        
        - their implementation using a Python `while` statement
    - 5+ Programming patterns end-of-file loop and ways of implementation such loops in Python
    - Design and implement solutions involving loop patterns including nested loop structures.
    - Basic ideas of Boolean algebra and be able to analyze and write Boolean expressions involving Boolean operators.

## 1.For loops

```
for <var> in <sequence>:
    <body>
```

`average1.py` simple for loop. 容易理解.

---

## 2.Indefinite Loops

`conditional loop`

```
while <condition>:
    <body>
```

Avoid writing indefinite loops in the first place.
