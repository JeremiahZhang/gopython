# 第三章: 数值计算

- 目标:
    - To understand the concept of data type.
    - To be familiar with the basic numeric data types in Python.
    - To understand the fundamental principles of how numbers are represented on a computer.
    - To be able to use the Python math library.
    - To understand the accumulator program pattern.
    - To be able to read and write programs that process numerical data.
- Sum:
    - The way a computer represents a particular kind of information is called a data type. The data type of an object determines what values it can have and what operations it supports.
    - Data types for representing numeric values, int and float(Python)
        - 整数: int
        - 分数: float
    - mathematical operations:
        - addition: `+`
        - subtraction: `-`
        - multiplication:  `*`
        - division: `/`
        - integer division: `//`
        - remainder: `%`
        - exponentiation: `**`
        - absolute value: `abs(x)`
    - python `math` library: `import math`

## 1.Numeric data types

> The information that is stored and manipulated by computer programs is generically referred to as **data**. Different kinds of data will be stored and manipulated in different ways.
