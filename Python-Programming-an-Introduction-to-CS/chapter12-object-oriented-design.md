# 第12章: 面向对象设计

书中介绍了面向对象设计流程, 一 racquetball sumulation 和 dice poker 案例为研究对象, 一步步解释程序, 与面向对象程序涉及过程.

- Look for object candidates
- Identify instance variables
- Think about interfaces.
- Refine nontrivial methods
- Design iteratively
- Try out alternatives.
- Keep it simple.

面向对象程序设计的三个基本原则:

- Encapsulation: Separating the implementation details of an object from how the object is used. This allows for modular design of complex programs.
- Polymorphism: Different classes may implement methods with the same signature. This makes programs more flexible, allowing a single line of code to call different methods in different situation.
- Inheritance: A new class can be derived from an existing class. This supports sharing of methods among classes and code reuse.
