## List basic

- A list is a sequence of items stored as a single object.
- Items in a list can be accessed by **indexing**, and sublists can be accessed by **slicing**.
- Lists are mutable, individual items or entire slices can be replaced throught assignment statements.
- Lists support a number of convenient and frequently used methods.
- List will grow and shrink as needed.

## Dictionary

## trick

In Python interpret:

`help("")` to search the help document of the str.

`help([])` to serach the help document of the list.

`help({})` to search the help document of the dictionary.

So helpful.
